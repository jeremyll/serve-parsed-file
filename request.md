## Request
Attached is a mock dataset of social media ad spend during the 2019 Canadian Election. It contains ad spend by each candidate, along with their party affiliation, and riding.

For this assignment, we would like it if you could write some backend code in a language of your choice that would ingest this file and then generate a simple front end web-page displaying the table of data.

Bonus points will be award if you can:

1- Make the front end as user friendly as possible e.g. sortable columns, professional look and feel etc. You don't need to go overboard here but one or two features would be nice to see but only if you have time.

2- Can also show above the table, the average, median and total spend per party.

Please do not feel any need to spend more than 3-4 hours on this. If this is not enough time to implement the assignment, please feel free to submit what you have and, if necessary, we can talk through what you would do to complete it in a future discussion.
